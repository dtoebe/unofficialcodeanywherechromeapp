## Unofficial Chrome Desktop App for Codeanywhere 

I created this because I love Codeanywhere's Cloud IDE, but I hate losing the small real estate from the bookmarks, URL, and tabs.
I will actively maintain this as long as necessary.  Codeanywhere says they are working on a chrome app themselves.  Once released I probably stop maintaining this.
This app so far is very simple and since I am not affiliated with the company I only have limited access to the client side, so I can only do so much.
Please feel free to post any issues or suggestions.  As for the codeanywhere team please feel free to use this code in any way.

Codeanywhere is my absolute favorite cloud IDE.  Code completion, advanced and minimalized interface.  Built-in sandbox, with capability to edit from other servers (DropBox, Google Drive, FTP, SFTP, FTPS).  With plans from free to 5/mo or $50/yr [Codeanywhere.com]( https://codeanywhere.com/)
